		<h2 id="action">Action</h2>
		<p>Takes two operands: a destination register <code>Rd</code> and a source register <code>Rs</code>.
		<br>The values of <code>Rd</code>, <code>Rs</code>, and the K flag (0 or 1) are added together, and the result is stored in <code>Rd</code>. The K flag is set to 1 if a carry was generated and 0 otherwise. The values are treated as unsigned integers, or equivalently, as 2's complement signed integers. All arithmetic operations 'wrap around' on overflow.</p>
		<p>If the instruction is conditional (<em>cond</em> = 1), and the P flag is 0, the instruction has no effect.</p>
		<h2 id="flags">Flags</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Z:</b> Set to 0 if the addition result (not including the carry out) was non-zero, and <b>unchanged</b> otherwise.</li>
			<li><b>S:</b> Set to the most significant bit of the addition result (not including the carry).</li>
			<li><b>K:</b> Carry into and out of the addition.</li>
			<li><b>V:</b> Set to 1 if 2's complement overflow occurred during the addition, and to 0 otherwise.</li>
			<li><b>P:</b> Unchanged.</li>
