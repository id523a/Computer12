		<p>This instruction takes 1 immediate 3-bit operand, <code>N</code>, ranging from 0 to 7.
		<br>It causes the next <code>N</code> executed instructions to only affect processor flags, and to not write their results to any registers, or to memory. Any <a href="ld.html">load</a> or <a href="st.html">store</a> instructions that occur within the next <code>N</code> instructions will be treated as a no-op.</p>
		<p>In combination with arithmetic instructions, this instruction is useful for performing numeric comparisons or bit testing without overwriting the values being compared. <code>cflg</code> can also be used to create conditional loads and stores.</p>
		<p>If the instruction is conditional (<em>cond</em> = 1), and the P flag is 0, this instruction has no effect. That is, subsequent instructions will execute normally.</p>

			<li>All flags are unaffected.</li>
