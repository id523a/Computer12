This project depends on several IP files for interfacing with a PS/2 keyboard
and mouse. They are available free of charge, but they may not have been
released under a license that allows me to package them directly in this repo.

* debounce.vhd and ps2_keyboard.vhd from:
https://www.digikey.com/eewiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=28278929

* ps2_mouse.vhd and ps2_transceiver.vhd from:
https://www.digikey.com/eewiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=70189075

All four files must be placed in this directory.
